App with backend

Fresh start.
This time i'll only upload the files in www.
And the final APK probably.

## Plans 

#### Users 

*Patients
*Doctors

#### Functions

*Both can register and login
*Patients can see doctors registered with the app
*Patients can see on which days doctors free
*and can apply for appointments.
*Doctors can view appointments.

App seems pretty straight forward after writing this readme file.
I'll be using web sql and local storage to store the info.
Web sql part can be replaced with db of choice. i guess.
